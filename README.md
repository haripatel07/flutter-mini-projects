# Mini Flutter Projects 

This repository is a collection of **mini Flutter projects** created to practice and strengthen skills in mobile app development.  

Each project focuses on a specific concept such as:
- UI building
- State management
- Form handling and validation
- Navigation
- API integration (future additions)

## Purpose
- Learn Flutter step by step through small, focused projects.

## Structure
Every project is stored in its own folder with clean and simple code.  

## Tech Stack
